Immediate

	Figure out how to clear static once a day -> You really need to do this
		And if ur url manual entering stuff on stock internal loading works
		It seems to work.
	Remove your flashes from loadportfolio optimizations that you're adding now.
		Youre changin it from -> not urlfor to urlfor
	To see static. 181.54 FB price
	Static directory apparently is still in like /static
	You have a bunch of functions where you optimize to INTERNAl. But if they enter in the URL manually before goin gto portfolio page you're fucked.



Short Term
	Figure out how the pd.to_csv works online
	To put graphs on the page instead of needing button (Can use AJAX) First part of front end video CS50 Web XMLHTTP request

Long Term




Change Notes
	Changing stocks to save in static file. 
		And internal initializer to take from static
		Saves to name(ticker)
	Changing compute action return dict keys to just the name vs mentioning date

Notes
	Yo its fucked if stocks with different tickers are given the same name within a portfolio
